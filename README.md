# ColoredMarkers

A project from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"> freecodecamp.org </a>, referring to the course <em>"Responsive Web Design"</em>, the third course I took was <em>"Learn CSS Colors by Building a Set of Colored Markers "</em>.

it's a  project, that I used a lot of **CSS** and a little bit of **HTML**, I worked with function colors and learned formats of color like **RGB**, **RGBA**, **HSL**, **HSLA** and <code>Hex</code>, also learned <code>linear-gradient</code> and their functions.
